This tutorial was actually really interesting, it's my first time doing anything at all related to LLM's and chatbots.
The concept of a walker was foreign to me but now makes so much sense and i am excited to build more things that do other cool things.
I was met with a lot of challenges doing this tutorial, mainly with authentication and server errors. But honestly going through 
the code to figure out the errors helped me understand everything much better. The LLMs in part 2 took really long to load - I would
have played around with them a little more if they buffered more quickly. I especially liked part 3
because I could customize it into something funny. This is making me really excited for this class,
so I'm glad its off to a good start with this tutorial.
